Codebook for Relevant Variables

This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan engines using maximum cycles of engines. The dataset used for this analysis contains sensor measurements and operational settings for 218 turbofan engines, along with their corresponding RUL values that we calculated. Below is a codebook for the relevant variables used in this project:

UnitNumber: A unique identifier for each engine in the dataset.

Time.inCycles.: The number of cycles that the engine has been in operation at the time of the measurement.

OS1-3: Operational settings 1-3, which represent different aspects of the engine's operation.

SM1-21: Sensor measurements 1-21, which represent various measurements of the engine's performance.

RUL: The Remaining Useful Life of the engine, calculated as the difference between the maximum cycle for the engine and the current cycle at the time of the measurement.

predicted_RUL: The predicted RUL value generated by the random forest model.

actual_RUL: The actual RUL value for the test data.

Note: The variable names used in this project are consistent with the original dataset, which can be found in the NASA Prognostics Center Repository.
